## Booting Pintos

>A1: Put the screenshot of Pintos running example here.



## Debugging

#### QUESTIONS: BIOS 

>B1: What is the first instruction that gets executed?

>> The PC hardware is designed to make sure BIOS always gets control of the machine first after the computer is powered on.The BIOS will be performing some test and initialization.

>B2: At which physical address is this instruction located?

>>The most important part of this reserved area is the BIOS, which occupies the 64KB region from 0x000F0000 through 0x000FFFFF.


#### QUESTIONS: BOOTLOADER

>B3: How does the bootloader read disk sectors? In particular, what BIOS interrupt is used?

>> The loader has to deal with disk directly with complex hardware programming routines.

>B4: How does the bootloader decides whether it successfully finds the Pintos kernel?

>>The loader's first job is to find the kernel by reading the partition table on each hard disk, looking for a bootable partition of the type used for a Pintos kernel.For example, IA32 bootloaders generally have to fit within 512 bytes in memory for a partition or floppy disk bootloader (i.e., only the first disk sector, and the last 2 bytes are fixed signatures for recognizing it is a bootloader).

>B5: What happens when the bootloader could not find the Pintos kernel?



>B6: At what point and how exactly does the bootloader transfer control to the Pintos kernel?



#### QUESTIONS: KERNEL

>B7: At the entry of pintos_init(), what is the value of expression `init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))]` in hexadecimal format?

>>

>B8: When `palloc_get_page()` is called for the first time,

>> B8.1 what does the call stack look like?
>>
>> 

>> B8.2 what is the return value in hexadecimal format?
>>
>> 

>> B8.3 what is the value of expression `init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))]` in hexadecimal format?
>>
>> 



>B9: When palloc_get_page() is called for the third time,

>> B9.1 what does the call stack look like?
>>
>> 

>> B9.2 what is the return value in hexadecimal format?
>>
>> 

>> B9.3 what is the value of expression `init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))]` in hexadecimal format?
>>
>> 



## Kernel Monitor

>C1: Put the screenshot of your kernel monitor running example here. (It should show how your kernel shell respond to `whoami`, `exit`, and `other input`.)

#### 

>C2: Explain how you read and write to the console for the kernel monitor.
