## Debugging

#### QUESTIONS: BIOS 

>B1: What is the first instruction that gets executed?

>>ljmp   $0x3630,$0xf000e05b

>B2: At which physical address is this instruction located?

>>0xffff0


#### QUESTIONS: BOOTLOADER

>B3: How does the bootloader read disk sectors? In particular, what BIOS interrupt is used?

>>we should have a look at **read_sector**:
>>
>>It first pushes some parameters essential for looking for the disk sector we are ready to read(CHS addressing),then uses BIOS interrupt 0x13.
>>
>>This kind of BIOS interrupt triggers a control transfer from user’s face program to an kernel’s face exception handler.
>>
>>From [the picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS_interrupt_call#:~:text=Extended%20Read%20Sectors) on Wikipedia,we could know that this kind of BIOS interrupt can provide sector-based hard disk and floppy disk read and write services.
>>
>>And from the line in loader.S:
>>
>>mov $0x42,%ah
>>
>>we can know exactly the functionality of the BIOS interrupt here is reading sectors from drive.

>B4: How does the bootloader decides whether it successfully finds the Pintos kernel?

>>![**First,check if the partition is used.**](https://github.com/FZYsheep/MarkdownPicture/blob/1b2094241508e362bb87d3ca7e212fcbc115e489/check1.png)
>>
>>If it is unused,go to the next partition(call next_partition function).If it is used,go on checking this partition.
>>
>>![**Then,check the type of this partition.**](https://github.com/FZYsheep/MarkdownPicture/blob/1b2094241508e362bb87d3ca7e212fcbc115e489/check2.png)
>>
>>If the type of this partition is the same the pintos kernel,we continue our examination for this partition.if not,we go to the next partition.
>>
>>![**Finally,check if this partition is bootable.**](https://github.com/FZYsheep/MarkdownPicture/blob/1b2094241508e362bb87d3ca7e212fcbc115e489/check3.png)
>>
>>If it is bootable,we finally find the bootloader,all we need to do next is to load the kernel into the physical memory.

>B5: What happens when the bootloader could not find the Pintos kernel?

>>If we couldn’t find kernel,print “Not found”.Then use BIOS interrupt 0x18 to notify BIOS that no bootable disk is present so that boot failed.


>B6: At what point and how exactly does the bootloader transfer control to the Pintos kernel?

>>**what point:**
>>
>>After finding kernel,loader starts to read the disk char by char and load the kernel into memory which starts at 0x2000. After this process finishes,the bootloader transfer control to kernel.
>>
>>**how exactly:**
>>
>>![](https://github.com/FZYsheep/MarkdownPicture/blob/1b2094241508e362bb87d3ca7e212fcbc115e489/control_transfer.png)
>>
>>We read the start address out of the ELF header and convert it from a 32-bit linear address into a 16:16 segment:offset(0x18) address for real mode, then jump to the converted address.The 80x86 doesn't have an instruction to jump to an absolute segment:offset kept in registers, so in fact we store the address in a temporary memory location(start), then use “ljmp” instruction to achieve control transfer.

#### QUESTIONS: KERNEL

>B7: At the entry of pintos_init(), what is the value of expression `init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))]` in hexadecimal format?
>> 
>> 0x0

>B8: When `palloc_get_page()` is called for the first time,

>> B8.1 what does the call stack look like?
>>> 
>>> palloc_get_page (flags=(PAL_ASSERT | PAL_ZERO)) at ../../threads/palloc.c:113
>>> 
>>> 0xc00203b1 in paging_init () at ../../threads/init.c:178
>>> 
>>> 0xc002031b in pintos_init () at ../../threads/init.c:109
>>> 
>>> 0xc002013d in start () at ../../threads/start.S:180

>> B8.2 what is the return value in hexadecimal format?
>>> 
>>> 0xc0101000

>> B8.3 what is the value of expression `init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))]` in hexadecimal format?
>>> 
>>> 0x0



>B9: When palloc_get_page() is called for the third time,

>> B9.1 what does the call stack look like?
>>> 
>>> palloc_get_page (flags=PAL_ZERO) at ../../threads/palloc.c:113
>>> 
>>> 0xc0020bef in thread_create (name=0xc002ea3d "idle", priority=0, function=0xc002101e <idle>, aux=0xc000efbc) at ../../threads/thread.c:178
>>> 
>>> 0xc0020ae4 in thread_start () at ../../threads/thread.c:111
>>> 
>>> 0xc0020334 in pintos_init () at ../../threads/init.c:128
>>> 
>>> 0xc002013d in start () at ../../threads/start.S:180

>> B9.2 what is the return value in hexadecimal format?
>>> 
>>> 0xc0103000

>> B9.3 what is the value of expression `init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))]` in hexadecimal format?
>>> 
>>> 0x102027



## Kernel Monitor

>C1: Put the screenshot of your kernel monitor running example here. (It should show how your kernel shell respond to `whoami`, `exit`, and `other input`.)
>> 
>> The input is `a`,`b`,`c`,`shg`,`whoami`,`exit` in order.
>> 
>> ![output screenshot](https://github.com/FZYsheep/MarkdownPicture/blob/dc7028260b2836689294fb4c15cb7dbf9248e056/monitor_shell.png)
#### 

>C2: Explain how you read and write to the console for the kernel monitor.
>> From **Loading** part in pintosbook,we know that input_init() sets up to merge serial and keyboard input into one stream. **pintos_init()** calls **input_init()** before handling the command line.So the input will be stored in buffer which is defined in input.c.
>> 
>> **int DealWithInput(char*buf):**  
>> The work of this function is to copy the input from keyboard to buf and return the number of bytes copied.I use a loop to do this.We can use **input_getc()** to read the input char by char,and add the character to buf.When the character we get is ‘\r’ or the length of the input exceeds MAXLINE,our copy ends.The length of buf stores in **size**.
>> 
>> **void run_shell(void):**  
>> Achieve our goal to run interactively.  
>> ![prompt and input](https://github.com/FZYsheep/MarkdownPicture/blob/bcabf59989dfc89e095f8f737f87e0008a738be3/prompt_input.png)
>> 
>> Before handling every command line,we first print prompt(“PKUOS> ”).Then call **DealWithInput(buf)** to complete copy and get the number of bytes we 
copied.Besides,Remove the character ‘\r’ at the end of buf and subtract one from size.
>> 
>> ![shell output](https://github.com/FZYsheep/MarkdownPicture/blob/bcabf59989dfc89e095f8f737f87e0008a738be3/shell_output.png)
>> 
>> If we type in a printable character,display the character.  
>> If we type in “exit”,just quit the monitor to allow the kernel to finish.  
>> If we type in “whoami”,print a student id.  
>> For the other input,print “Invalid command”.
